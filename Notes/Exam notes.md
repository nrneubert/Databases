==Index==: data structure that facilitates quicker access to a data. 
- *can be* used for both main memory and disk!

<u>Main memory vs. disk</u>:
- Data access from disk is typically 2 orders of magnitude slower. 
- Data in main memory is **volatile**, while **non-volatile** for disk.
- Disk is solely mechanical moving parts, while main memory is completely electronic.


==Checkpointing==: process where the system periodically writes all modified (*dirty*) pages from memory to disk.
- improves **recovery** efficiency
- ensures a **consistent** state can be restored after unexpected crash.
- *reduces overhead of logging* by periodically writing everything to disk.

==Shadow-paging==: copy-on-write technique for avoiding in-place updates of pages
- when a page is modified (*dirty*), the system writes changes to a **new (shadow) page** instead of overwriting the old.
- upon commit the page table pointer is switched to the new page (**atomic**!). 
$\approx$ no-undo / no-redo

$\Longrightarrow$ *possible to use both techniques, but often redundant because both handle recovery well*.

==Undo==: rollback changes of *uncommited* transactions
==Redo==: reapply changes of *commited* transactions after a crash. 

==Steal==: *uncommited* dirty pages <u>can be</u> written, so you need to ***undo*** them.
- e.g. to save space in main memory you flush the dirty pages more often.
==Force==: *commited* pages are <u>immediately</u> written (forced!) to disk, so you do not need to repeat them (***no-redo***). 
- generally not favorable because it leads to a ton of continuously costly I/Os

|              | Steal          | No-steal          |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| **Force**    | Undo / no-redo | No-undo / no-redo |
| **No-force** | Undo / redo    | No-undo / redo    |

==Undo/redo==:
1. Undo all transactions that has a log entry of *"start"* but no *"commit"*.
2. Redo all transactions that has a long entry of *"start"* and *"commit"*.


==B+-trees==
- tailored for disk-based data organization: *aligns with disk block sizes, so very efficient for disk storage and access.*
