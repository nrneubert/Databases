##### Exercise 21.26
Consider the following two transactions. Analyze the following schedule and explain whether T2 operations are updated successfully when T1 is rolled back.

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    |            |
| X := X - 2 |            |
| write(X)   |            |
|            | read(X)    |
|            | X := X + 3 |
|            | write(X)   |
| ROLLBACK   |            |
|            | COMMIT     |

It depends on the isolation level of the system. 
`READ UNCOMMITTED`: would allow for $T_2$ to perform a dirty read *after* $T_1$ has changed $X$. 
`READ COMMITTED`: would not allow $T_2$ to perform a dirty read, because $T_2$ can not read the write(X) from $T_1$ before it is finally commited. 

#### Exercise 20.16
Add the operation commit at the end of each of the transactions and then give an example of a schedule of each of the following types:

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    | read(X)    |
| X := X - N | X := X + M |
| write(X)   | write(X)   |
| read(X)    |            |
| Y := Y + N |            |
| write(Y)   |            |

- Recoverable
No commit until all transactions that have written an item that is read have committed also

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    |            |
| X := X - N |            |
| write(X)   |            |
| read(X)    |            |
|            | read(X)    |
|            | X := X + M |
|            | write(X)   |
| read(Y)    |            |
| Y := Y + N |            |
| write(Y)   |            |
| *commit*   |            |
|            | *commit*   |

- Non-recoverable

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    |            |
| X := X - N |            |
| write(X)   |            |
| read(X)    |            |
|            | read(X)    |
|            | X := X + M |
|            | write(X)   |
|            | commit     |
| read(Y)    |            |
| Y := Y + N |            |
| write(Y)   |            |
| commit     |            |


- Cascadeless
read only items written by committed transactions.
$T_2$ must *not* read any uncommitted items 

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    |            |
| X := X - N |            |
| write(X)   |            |
| read(X)    |            |
| read(Y)    |            |
| Y := Y + N |            |
| write(Y)   |            |
| *commit*   |            |
|            | read(Y)    |
|            | Y := Y + N |
|            | write(Y)   |
|            | *commit*   |


- Strict
 neither read or write item until the last transaction that wrote it has committed.

| $T_1$      | $T_2$      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| read(X)    |            |
| X := X - N |            |
| write(X)   |            |
| read(X)    |            |
| read(Y)    |            |
| Y := Y + N |            |
| write(Y)   |            |
| *commit*   |            |
|            | read(Y)    |
|            | Y := Y + N |
|            | write(Y)   |
|            | *commit*   |

#### Exercise 20.20
Consider the Employee database schema:
`Staff(sid, sname, position, age, did)`
`Department(nane, address, room, did)`
`Project(pnum, pname)`
`Customer(cid, cname, orderid)`
For each of the following transactions, state and explain the SQL isolation level that is suitable for each transactions.

1. Insert a staff identified by his/her id into the department named 'Marketing'
Probably `REPEATABLE READ` because you need a lock on rows but not on range. 
For most safe procedure `SERIALIZABLE` could also be favored.

2. Change department for a staff identified by his/her id from one department to another department.
For others to have consistent results when pulling data from departments, you need a lock on the rows: `REPEATABLE READ`.

3. Find the total number of customers for an executive report on the overall market development. 
Seeing as though it is a "report", it may allow for some errors: phantom or dirty reads. It depends on the usage.
Either `READ COMMITED` or if you are feeling cool `READ UNCOMMITED`. 

#### Exercise 21.25
Apply the timestamp ordering algorithm to the schedules in Figures 21.8(b) and determine whether the algorithm will allow the execution of the schedules.

so none of the transactions will be aborted.
